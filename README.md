# **OVERVIEW**

This repository is focused on showing my evolution and learning path, mainly through projects and application files to apply and test new features and concepts from my programming studies.

## *CURRENT FOCUS*

I'm focused on learning *JavaScript for backend development*, using node.js to work with APIs. After studying this language, I plain to learn TypeScript for a more focused understanding.
As a secondary focus, *I'm learning MySQL and API usage with express*.

# **ORGANIZATION**

## *practice*

Files where I try to *apply the things I learn in complete programs*.

### *console-projects*
#### Marked files is complete, and working (when tested)

- [x] 1st_project_user_record.js - A project applying the first features and functions of the language;
- [x] class_control.js - A simple class-control program that works with predefined grades and calculates if the student passed or not;
- [x] Coin_conversor.js - A project that converts currencies and displays them in a console table;
- [x] complete_calculator.js - A more complete calculator that handles more types of calculations, but still with predefined values;
- [x] film_recommend.js - A simple project that shows a film and its information;
- [x] greater_less.js - With two predefined values, it tells which one is greater or smaller;
- [x] how_much_days_lived.js - Gets predefined user information and calculates how many days the person has lived;
- [x] investment_simulation.js - A simple project where the user enters information and the code calculates the investment return;
- [x] Multiples_auto.js - A project using a loop for the first time to show multiplication values in groups;
- [x] number_guess.js - A small game where the code picks a random number up to one hundred, and the user has to guess it, with a small life system;
- [x] Number_Identifiers.js - A project that gets a number and shows, through classifications, whether it fits into each one;
- [x] Password_gerator.js - A more complex project where the user enters how many digits the password needs, and with random values the code creates a password using only letters and numbers;
- [x] pomodoro_clock.js - A simple pomodoro clock where the user gives the focus time, rest time, and how many repeats;
- [x] quiz.js - A simple quiz with predefined values, used to start applying control flow;
- [x] Simple_calculator.js - Literally a simple calculator that gets two values and performs a calculation;
- [x] Temperature_calculator.js - With a predefined value, calculates the temperature in Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit, and shows if it is considered hot, cold, or cool;
- [x] text_decodifier.js - Gets text from the user and converts it to a Unicode-like format, and also reverses it back;

### *APIs*
#### programming projects using APIs model

- [ ] Stock_API - API of a stock control application, first project with API routes and multiple code files

---
